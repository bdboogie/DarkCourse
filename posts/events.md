## Captain's Drive In
It is down to the Captain to schedule the annual Captain’s Drive In. Typically this has been arranged for the first full weekend in the year (unless the 1st falls on a Saturday).

This is essentially the Captain’s day, as we no longer have a Lady Captain, the ladies section will put forward someone to take part however you will organise everything.

It is an opportunity to raise money for your charity (more on that later) and various draws, raffles can be organised if you want to.

The format of the drive in is fairly simple. A single shot from the Yellow Tee for the Captain and a single drive* from the Red Tee for the ladies representative.
