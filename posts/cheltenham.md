#### Background
This is a 4 person team Open Day, based on a team stableford with two scores to count (the Captain may alterthis annual to include other scoring varioations i.e. all to count on par 3s etc.)
The date is arranged for the Friday events of the Cheltenham Gold Cup week. It is organised as a shotgun start so players can then watch the racing in the clubhouse after the golf. 
Previously a tote has been organised in house although with online betting services this may now be redundant unless there is a need to generate income for charities or further events.
(Due to the shotgun nature of the event it is not currently possible to organise this event the  BRS Opens module)
